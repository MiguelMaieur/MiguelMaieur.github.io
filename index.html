              <p>I'm 36 years old and live in Heule near Kortrijk with my wife and two kids. In 2006 I enrolled in the class of Ditital arts and entertainment where I learned to program. There I learned C++,C#,Java and vb. But I was not able to complete it because I can't draw.
              Then I followed a class C# at the trainig center of the vdab. In 2011 I started my first job as a programmer. In recent years I have mainly worked with CRM applications</p>
